# Mining Pools

**Following a true decentralized path, Nimiq does not provide an official pool but the implementation of the [Nimiq Pool Server](https://github.com/nimiq-network/mining-pool) for community members to implement their own pool**. 

Below is a list of Mining Pools managed by community members. You can talk to pools members in the Pools Section of [Nimiq Discord](https://discord.gg/92qaVKH).
